## What is React?

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It was developed by Facebook and is now maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies.

React allows developers to create large web applications that can update and render efficiently in response to data changes. It's component-based structure lets you build complex UIs from small, isolated and reusable pieces of code.

## Why Use React?

There are several reasons why React has become popular among developers:

1. **Component-Based**: In React, you build encapsulated components that manage their own state and then compose them to make complex UIs. It encourages reusability and readability in your code.

2. **Fast & Efficient**: React uses a virtual DOM (Document Object Model) and efficient diffing algorithms to limit the amount of direct manipulation of the DOM, which is slower.

3. **Rich Ecosystem**: React has a massive community and ecosystem with a plethora of libraries and tools available to help solve just about any problem you'll encounter.

## Getting Started with React

To get started with React, you can use the Create React App CLI tool, which sets up a new project with sensible defaults and best practices.

```bash
npx create-react-app my-app
